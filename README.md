AnySplat introduces a novel approach to 3D Gaussian splatting from uncalibrated images. The method employs a transformer-based geometry encoder, which processes the input images and generates a structured representation of the scene. Following this, three decoder heads work in tandem to reconstruct the 3D scene.
